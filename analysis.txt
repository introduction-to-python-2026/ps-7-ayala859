Data Analysis Summary: California Housing Dataset
Database Name: California Housing Dataset (Derived from the 1990 U.S. Census).

Analyzed Columns:

total_rooms: Total number of rooms within a block.

housing_median_age: Median age of the houses in a block.

median_income: Median income for households in a block.

median_house_value: Median house price (Target Variable).

Correlation Results
Based on your correlation matrix and scatter plots, the following insights emerged:

Strongest Predictor: There is a strong positive correlation (approximately 0.69) between Median Income and House Value. This indicates that as the wealth of the residents increases, house prices rise significantly.

Moderate/Weak Link: Total Rooms has a slight positive correlation with price, but it is far less influential than income.

Minimal Impact: Housing Median Age shows a very weak linear relationship with the house value in this specific dataset.

Key Conclusion
The primary driver of housing prices in California is the economic status of the residents (Median Income). If you were to build a machine learning model to predict home prices, income would be your most important feature.

Note: You may have noticed a "line" of data points at the $500,000 mark in your scatter plots; this is because the dataset is capped at that price, which is a common characteristic of this specific database.
